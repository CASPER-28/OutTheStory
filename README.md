# OutTheStory
"Out of the Story" (in Arabic: "برا القصة") is a phrase used to describe a player in social deduction games who is not aware of a key piece of information that the other players share. This concept is similar to the idea of an "imposter" or someone who doesn't know the word or theme that the rest of the group knows.
